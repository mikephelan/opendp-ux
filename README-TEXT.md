# How Update Text in DP Creator

The help text for DP Creator is loaded using a locales file, which is created as part of the
build process.
The source for the building the locales file is in the build_locale directory:
```
client
|--build_locale
   |--CreateLocaleJson.js  (script runs at build time; converts DPCreatorText.csv to en.json) 
   |--DPCreatorText.csv   (versioned in Github - update this with new text)
|--src
    |--locales
        |--en.json      (generated by CreateLocaleJson.js)



To make it easy for others to review and update the text, it is saved as a Google doc here:  
[DP Creator Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cOKfTZvI_zxHaT_-aagDbg1fPsPyBuWRIM4YPh8QExs/edit?usp=sharing)  


A PDF of the DP Creater UI with text sections marked is here: [DP Creator Text Sections](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1elqKdPp1s41hiyZ_ls1ze00k58qRXQQm/view?usp=sharing)


After updating the text in the spreadsheet - 
1. Download the spreadsheet in CSV format
2. Update DPCreatorText.csv with the new file
3. Build and deploy the app
